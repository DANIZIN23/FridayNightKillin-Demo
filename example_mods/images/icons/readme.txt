Put your custom character icons here!
Icons must start with "icon-" or it won't be read!
If the icon is non-animated, the image resolution must have be at least 300x150

Animated icons are supported, all you need to do is put your xml, png and json in this folder.

You can find an example of the json you should use in assets/images/icons/icon-gaster.json.
Also, you shouldn't really have a need for offsets, but still included it in case so go wild

PS : If animated, you NEED to set a normal animation. Losing/Winning icon is optional, but normal is needed.
As usual, animation names should stay the same. Winning icons are not supported with non-animated icons.

"yourCharacter-normal",
"yourCharacter-losing",
"yourCharacter-winning"
